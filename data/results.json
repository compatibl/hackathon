Choose the type of financial instrument from this list (e.g., 'AcceleratedReturnEquityLinkedNote'). This is the most important field and you should maximize your accuracy here. Consider the following:\nAccelerated Return Equity Linked Note: An investment product tied to the performance of an underlying equity index, often with a predetermined maturity date. It may offer accelerated returns or early redemption if certain conditions are met, such as the underlying index reaching specific levels.\n\nAutocallable Equity Linked Note: Similar to an Accelerated Return Equity Linked Note, but with an automatic call feature. If the underlying index reaches a predefined level, the note is called early, providing investors with their principal plus gains.\n\nAutocallable Equity Linked Range Accrual Note: Combines elements of an Autocallable Note and a Range Accrual Note. It offers early redemption if the underlying index reaches specific levels within a range and includes range-based interest accrual.\n\nAutocallable Fixed Rate Note: An Autocallable Note with a fixed interest rate component. Early redemption may occur if the underlying index reaches predetermined levels, with fixed interest payments throughout the term.\n\nCallable Equity Linked Note: An equity-linked investment with a call option that allows the issuer to redeem the note early under certain conditions. Investors may receive principal protection, depending on the terms.\n\nCallable Fixed-for-Floating Swap: A structured financial product combining fixed and floating interest rates. It includes a call option that allows the issuer to terminate the swap under specific circumstances.\n\nCallable Fixed Rate Note: Similar to Callable Equity Linked Note but with a fixed interest rate component. It provides potential early redemption and fixed interest payments.\n\nCallable Floating Spread Note: Combines a callable feature with floating interest rates and a spread. The issuer can terminate the note, and investors receive floating rate payments plus a spread.\n\nKnock-Out Commodity Linked Note: Linked to the performance of a commodity index, with a knockout feature. If the commodity index falls to a certain level, the note may terminate, resulting in a loss of principal.\n\nKnock-Out Equity Linked Note: Similar to a Knock-Out Commodity Linked Note but linked to an equity index. If the index drops to a specified level, the note may terminate early.\n\nNon-Callable Commodity Linked Note: A commodity-linked investment without a call option, providing exposure to the performance of a commodity index over a specified period.\n\nNon-Callable Currency Linked Note: A currency-linked investment without a call option, offering exposure to foreign exchange rate movements and potential returns based on currency performance.\n\nNon-Callable Equity Linked Note: An equity-linked investment without a callable feature, providing returns based on the underlying equity index's performance.\n\nNon-Callable Fixed-for-Floating Swap: A structured product combining fixed and floating interest rates, with no callable feature, and typically offering a specific term and payment structure.\n\nNon-Callable Fixed-to-Floating Note: A financial product with fixed-to-floating interest rates and no call option. The note may have a predefined term and payment schedule.\n\nNon-Callable Floating Spread Note: Similar to a Callable Floating Spread Note but without the callable feature. It offers returns based on floating interest rates and a spread.\n\nNon-Callable Inflation-Linked Note: A bond linked to an inflation index, providing returns adjusted for inflation. It lacks a callable feature and offers principal protection.\n\n\n* Scan the text for specific mentions of \"auto-call\", \"automatically call\" or \"automatic call\". If you find any, the instrument is ALWAYS Autocallable\n* Scan the text for specific mentions of \"accrue\", \"accrued\", \"accrued interest\", \"range\" when describing the automatic calling process, the instrument is AutocallableEquityLinkedRangeAccrualNote.\n* Scan the text for mentions of Maturity Date, Automatic Call Feature and Coupon Payments. If you see these, then this is an Accelerated Return type of note. In this case it is NOT noncallable\n\n- Notional: Specify the principal or notional amount (a numerical value) for the financial product. This is NOT the number of units. This can be calculated as the following : x = number of units. y = amount per unit. Specify the notional as the product of x with y.\n- FixedLegNotional: Specify the notional amount for the fixed leg, if applicable.\n- FloatingLegNotional: Specify the notional amount for the floating leg, if applicable.\n- Currency: Indicate the currency of payments in ISO-4217 format (e.g., 'USD').\n- FixedLegCurrency: Specify the currency of payments for the fixed leg, if applicable.\n- FloatingLegCurrency: Specify the currency of payments for the floating leg, if applicable.\n- EffectiveDate: Provide the effective date in yyyy-mm-dd format (e.g., '2023-01-15'). The day and month should be close to each other in the text. Do not combine different days and months that are far apart in the text.\n- MaturityDate: Indicate the maturity date in yyyy-mm-dd format (e.g., '2028-01-15').\n- PayOrReceiveFixed: Choose either 'PayFixed' or 'ReceiveFixed' for a fixed-for-floating interest rate instrument.\n- FixedRatePercent: Specify the fixed interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 4.5%) If you are not sure, fill this field with null and not 0.\n- Underlying: Provide the identifier of the underlying asset. This identifier is NOT the name of the stock. The identifier is the ticker name or the specific period of LIBOR where applicable\n- Underlying2: Specify the identifier of a second underlying asset, if applicable.\n- FloatingSpreadBp: Only applicable if this financial instrument is CallableFixedForFloatingSwap or CallableFloatingSpreadNote or NonCallableFixedForFloatingSwap or NonCallableFixedToFloatingNote or NonCallableFloatingSpreadNote, null otherwise. If this financial instrument  is any of those mentioned, then it is calculated as the spread over the floating index in basis points (e.g., 200). \n- FloatingRateMultiplier: Specify the multiplier used in the calculation of the floating rate.\n- FloatingRateCapPct: Find the floating rate cap as a percentage (e.g., 5%).\n- FloatingRateFloorPct: Find the floating rate floor as a percentage (e.g., 2%).\n- PaymentFrequency: Find out the payment frequency from the text.. If not present in the text and you are not sure, just fill with 'null'.\n- FixedLegPaymentFrequency: Specify the payment frequency of the fixed leg, if applicable.\n- FloatingLegPaymentFrequency: Specify the payment frequency of the floating leg, if applicable.\n- ResetType: Choose either 'Upfront' or 'InArrears' for the floating rate reset.\n- ExerciseFrequency: Find the exercise frequency of an embedded option (e.g., 'Semiannual').\n- ParticipationRatePct: Specify the participation rate as a percentage (e.g., 150%).\n- CappedValueOfUnderlying: Specify the capped value of the underlying asset.\n- CappedReturnPct: Specify the capped return of the underlying as a percentage (e.g., 12%).\n- BufferAmountPct: Specify the buffer amount as a percentage (e.g., 5%).\n- TriggerLevel: Specify the trigger level for knockout, knockin, or autocall.\n- TriggerLevelPct: Specify the trigger level as a percentage of its initial value (e.g., 90%).\n- PrincipalProtected: Find in the text if the principal is protected and fill either 'Yes' or 'No' for principal protection.\n- InitialPrice: Specify the initial price of the underlying asset. If not present in the text, fill with 'null'.\n- RateUponTriggerPct: Specify the rate of return paid in case of knockout (e.g., 10%).\n- CpiLagMonths: Specify the lag of the CPI index observation in months, if applicable. This lag is the number of months prior to the month in which the applicable interest period ends.\n- WorstOf: Choose either 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate if the instrument is linked to the worst performance of several assets.\n- CUSIP: Specify the CUSIP number that consists of nine characters, which can be a combination of letters and numbers.\n\nAfter filling everything, review any inconsistencies across fields and return only a valid JSON\n\nTerm sheet: ```{input}```"
