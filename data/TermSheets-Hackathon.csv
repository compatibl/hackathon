AutocallableEquityLinkedNote.1,"- General
  - The Notes are designed for investors who seek a Contingent Interest Payment with respect to each Observation Date for which the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to 61% of the Initial Price, which we refer to as the Coupon Barrier Level. Investors should be willing to forgo fixed interest and dividend payments, in exchange for the opportunity to receive Contingent Interest Payments.
  - Investors in the Notes should be willing to accept the risk of losing some or all of their principal and the risk that no Contingent Interest Payment may be made with respect to some or all Observation Dates. Any payment on the Notes is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
  - The Notes will be automatically called if the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on any Observation Date (other than the first and final Observation Dates) is greater than or equal to the Initial Price. The first Observation Date, and therefore the earliest date on which an automatic call may be initiated, is September 22, 2014.
  - Unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. maturing August 27, 2015†
  - Minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof
  - The Notes are expected to price on or about August 22, 2014 and are expected to settle on or about August 27, 2014. The Pricing Date, for purposes of the Notes, is the day that the terms of the Notes become final. The Initial Price has been determined by reference to the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on August 21, 2014, subject to adjustments, and not by reference to the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on the Pricing Date.

- Key Terms
  - Reference Stock: The Class A common stock, par value of $0.001 per share, of GameStop Corp. (Bloomberg ticker: “GME”). We refer to GameStop Corp. as “GameStop.”
  - Contingent Interest Payments: If the Notes have not been automatically called and the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on any Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Level, you will receive on the applicable Contingent Interest Payment Date for each $1,000 principal amount Note a Contingent Interest Payment equal to at least $12.50* (equivalent to an interest rate of at least 15.00%* per annum, payable at a rate of at least 1.25%* per month).
    - If the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on any Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Level, no Contingent Interest Payment will be made with respect to that Observation Date.
  - Coupon Barrier Level / Knock-In Level: $24.6989, which is 61% of the Initial Price (subject to adjustments)
  - Contingent Interest Rate: At least 15.00%* per annum, payable at a rate of at least 1.25%* per month, if applicable
    - *The actual Contingent Interest Rate will be provided in the pricing supplement and will not be less than 15.00% per annum.
  - Automatic Call: If the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on any Observation Date (other than the first and final Observation Dates) is greater than or equal to the Initial Price, the Notes will be automatically called for a cash payment, for each $1,000 principal amount Note, equal to (a) $1,000 plus (b) the Contingent Interest Payment applicable to that Observation Date, payable on the applicable Call Settlement Date.
  - Payment at Maturity: If the Notes have not been automatically called and the Final Price is greater than or equal to the Knock-In Level, you will receive a cash payment at maturity, for each $1,000 principal amount Note, equal to (a) $1,000 plus (b) the Contingent Interest Payment applicable to the Valuation Date.
    - If the Notes have not been automatically called and the Final Price is less than the Knock-In Level, at maturity you will lose 1% of the principal amount of your Notes for every 1% that the Final Price is less than the Initial Price. Under these circumstances, your payment at maturity per $1,000 principal amount Note will be calculated as follows: $1,000 + ($1,000 × Stock Return)
    - If the Notes have not been automatically called and the Final Price is less than the Knock-In Level, you will lose more than 39% of your principal amount and could lose up to the entire principal amount of your Notes at maturity.
  - Stock Return: (Final Price – Initial Price) / Initial Price
  - Initial Price: The closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on August 21, 2014, which was $40.49, divided by the Stock Adjustment Factor. The Initial Price is not determined by reference to the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on the Pricing Date.

NonCallableFloatingSpreadNote.1,"Summary:
  - The notes offered by this pricing supplement are unsecured debt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and guaranteed by Citigroup Inc. The notes will pay interest at a floating rate based on 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR during the LIBOR period specified below and based on the CMS spread (as described below) during the CMS spread period specified below. The notes will have characteristics of a conventional floating rate note based on 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR during the LIBOR period. However, during the CMS spread period, the floating rate payable on the notes will vary not based on a single market interest rate, but rather based on the spread between two constant maturity swap rates of different maturities. This may result in a floating rate during the CMS spread period that is significantly less than it would have been had it continued to be based on 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR. Interest payments on the notes will fluctuate and may be paid at a rate as low as 0% for one or more interest periods.
  - There is uncertainty about the future of 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR as well as the Constant Maturity Swap (CMS) rates used to calculate the CMS spread, and such uncertainty may adversely affect the return on and value of the notes.. The amount of interest payable on the notes may be calculated using one or more substitute or successor rates selected by the issuer (or one of its affiliates), which may be subject to adjustment by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer, if 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR or a relevant CMS rate is discontinued. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives, and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of securities, such as the notes, that are linked to such rates. See “Summary Risk Factors” and “Determination of 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR” and “Information About the CMS Spread” in this pricing supplement.
  - Investors in the notes must be willing to accept (i) an investment that may have limited or no liquidity and (ii) the risk of not receiving any amount due under the notes if we and Citigroup Inc. default on our obligations. All payments on the notes are subject to the credit risk of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc.

- Interest will be paid on the 25th day of each month, beginning August 25, 2008.
- The annualized interest rate applicable to any interest period will equal the CPI Inflation Adjustment (as defined below) multiplied by the Participation Rate (as defined below). We further describe how to determine the interest payable on the notes beginning on page PS-3.
- As described in more detail below, the CPI Inflation Adjustment will equal the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (the “CPI”) between (a) the month that is 15 months prior to the month in which the applicable interest period ends and (b) the month that is 3 months prior to the month in which the applicable interest period ends.
- The Participation Rate is 123%.
- Interest Payment Terms
    - For each monthly interest period, we will determine the CPI Inflation Adjustment.
    - If the CPI Inflation Adjustment is greater than zero, you will receive interest for that interest period.
    - If the CPI Inflation Adjustment is equal to or less than zero, no interest will be paid for that interest period.
    - The amount of interest due for any interest period will be determined based on a rate equal to the applicable CPI Inflation Adjustment multiplied by the Participation Rate.
    - If an interest payment is due for an interest period, it will be paid on the 25th day of the applicable month, beginning in August 2008.
    - Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
    - If any interest payment date or the maturity date of the notes falls on a day that is not a business day, we will make the required payment on the next business day, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the payment made on the next business day.
    - However, if an interest payment date falls on a date that is not a business day, and the next business day is in the next calendar month, the interest payment date will be the immediately preceding business day.",NonCallableInflationLinkedNote,,,2013-07-25,14878000,,,USD,,,,,CPI,,,,,,,Monthly,,,,123,,,,,,,,,,3,
